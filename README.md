Environment Sensing 
Localization using Ultrasound Unit

Energy Harvesting using e-peas 

Image Processing using Matlab and Python
Hardware Accelerator using Xilinx

Low power FPGA using Hspice

Robotic System Development using ROS
Robotic Control using National Instrument RIO boards 

Data Centralization using AWS Lambda
Data Acquisition using LoRA and satellite Network
High-performance Computing using ARCHER Supercomputer

Artificial Interestlligence using Google Cloud
