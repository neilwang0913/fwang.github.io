# Hello World ! Welcome to My Page ^^

I'm passionate about understanding the relationship between Art and STEM. By exploring and creating the different objectives, I hope to understand the world and myself better.

I have worked on from component to system level design including simulation and fabrciation for different applications:

```markdown
- Environment Sensing 

- Localization using Ultrasound Unit

- Energy Harvesting using e-peas 

- Image Processing using Matlab and Python

- Hardware Accelerator using Xilinx FPGA

- OpenRSIC and RSIC-V using Intel FPGA

- Low power FPGA using Hspice

- Robotic System Development using ROS

- Robotic Control using National Instrument RIO boards 

- Data Centralization using cloud service(AWS, Azure, Google, Oracle)

- Data Acquisition using wireless node(Wifi, LoRA and satellite Network)

- High-performance Computing using ARCHER Supercomputer

- Artificial Interestlligence using TPU

```
